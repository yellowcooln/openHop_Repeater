# openHop Repeater

Lightweight Python MeshCore repeater daemon built on `openhop_core`.

Formerly `pyMC_Repeater` built on `pyMC_core`.

openHop Repeater is designed to run continuously on low-power Linux hardware such
as Raspberry Pi-class devices, Proxmox LXC containers, and network-attached
radio modems. It forwards LoRa packets, exposes a web dashboard, and provides
configuration tools for radio setup, policy management, monitoring, and
integrations.

## Overview

The repeater daemon runs as a background service and forwards LoRa packets using
the `openhop_core` dispatcher and routing stack. The project favors a simple,
hackable architecture:

- CherryPy provides a lightweight HTTP server for the web UI and API.
- The web interface supports setup, monitoring, logs, configuration, and updates.
- Packet routing, policy checks, storage, sensors, GPS, MQTT, and optional
  pyMC_Glass integration are kept in modular components.
- Hardware support covers direct SPI radios, CH341 USB-to-SPI adapters,
  pyMC TCP/USB modem firmware, and KISS serial modems.

Real-world deployment feedback is especially welcome. Dense networks, unusual
hardware, and production-style installations are the best way to find the rough
edges and make the repeater better for everyone.

## Installation

### Install Git

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git -y
```

### Clone The Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openhop-dev/openhop_repeater.git
cd openhop_repeater
```

### Quick Install

```bash
sudo bash ./manage.sh install
```

The installer will:

- Create a dedicated `repeater` service user with hardware access
- Install application files to `/opt/openhop_repeater`
- Create the configuration directory at `/etc/openhop_repeater`
- Create the log directory at `/var/log/openhop_repeater`
- Launch the interactive radio and hardware setup wizard

sudo journalctl -u openhop-repeater -f
```

Open the web dashboard at:

```text
http://<repeater-ip>:8000
```

### Development Install

```bash
pip install -e .
```

For development tools:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Configuration

The main configuration file is created during installation:

```text
/etc/openhop_repeater/config.yaml
```

### Reconfigure Radio And Hardware

To reconfigure radio and hardware settings after installation:

```bash
sudo bash setup-radio-config.sh /etc/openhop_repeater
```

You can also launch the management menu:

```bash
sudo ./manage.sh
sudo systemctl restart openhop-repeater
```

### Optional pyMC_Glass Integration

openHop Repeater supports an optional `glass` configuration section for
pyMC_Glass control-plane integration. When enabled, the repeater sends periodic
`/inform` payloads to pyMC_Glass, receives queued commands, and reports command
results on the next inform cycle.

Minimal example:

```yaml
glass:
  enabled: true
  base_url: "http://localhost:8080"
  inform_interval_seconds: 30
```

## Authentication

Local web password login is the default. Optional OIDC login can be enabled for
Authentik or another standards-compliant provider with `web.auth.mode` set to
`local_and_oidc` or `oidc`. Start with `local_and_oidc`, verify both an allowed
member and a denied non-member identity, then switch to `oidc` only after API
token recovery is working. See [docs/authentik-oidc.md](docs/authentik-oidc.md).

OIDC controls web login only. The MeshCore admin and guest passwords under
`repeater.security` remain separate protocol credentials and are not replaced by
OIDC.

Automation and the local CLI can use API tokens. Put the token in an environment
variable or a protected file; do not pass API tokens as command arguments:

```bash
export OPENHOP_API_TOKEN="replace-with-api-token"
pymc-cli --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

```bash
install -m 600 /dev/null ~/.config/openhop/api-token
printf '%s\n' 'replace-with-api-token' > ~/.config/openhop/api-token
pymc-cli --api-token-file ~/.config/openhop/api-token
```

Configuration exports redact secrets by default, including OIDC client secrets.
Authenticated full backups requested with `include_secrets=true` include secrets
for restore purposes and must be stored accordingly.

## Policy Engine

Use the policy engine to create packet management rules from the
web interface.

![Policy](docs/config-policy.png)

### Example: Drop Channel packets over two hops
![Policy Example](docs/policy-example1.png)

## Upgrading

### Web Interface

The web interface can upgrade an installation or switch branches.

> [!NOTE]
> Docker installs cannot be upgraded or branch-switched from the web interface.
> Update the container image instead.

![Upgrade](docs/webui-upgrade.png)

### CLI

```bash
cd openhop_repeater
sudo bash ./manage.sh upgrade
```

The upgrade script will:

- Pull the latest code from the main branch
- Update application files
- Upgrade Python dependencies if needed
- Restart the service automatically
- Preserve the existing configuration

## Proxmox LXC Installation

openHop Repeater can run inside a Proxmox LXC container using a CH341 USB-to-SPI
adapter or a TCP modem. This is useful for headless, always-on deployments
without dedicating a full Raspberry Pi.

### Requirements

Software:

- Proxmox VE 7.x or 8.x host
- Internet access for the container

Hardware, choose one:

- CH341 USB-to-SPI adapter with VID `1a86` and PID `5512`, connected to the
  Proxmox host and wired to an SX1262-based LoRa module such as an Ebyte
  E22-900M30S
- TCP modem, such as MeshSmith EtherMesh

### One-Line Install

Run this command on the Proxmox host, not inside a container:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openhop-dev/openhop_repeater/main/scripts/proxmox-install.sh)"
```

Replace `main` in the URL with another branch name if needed.

The installer will prompt for container settings (container ID, hostname, RAM,
disk, bridge, etc.) and then:

1. Download a Debian 12 LXC template.
2. Create a privileged container with USB passthrough.
3. Install a host-side udev rule for the CH341 device.
4. Clone the repository and pre-seed CH341 GPIO pin mappings.
5. Run `manage.sh install` inside the container.
6. Display the dashboard URL.

### Default Container Settings

| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| Container ID | Next available |
| Hostname | `openhop-repeater` |
| RAM | 1024 MB |
| Disk | 4 GB |
| CPU cores | 2 |
| Bridge | `vmbr0` |
| Storage | `local-lvm` |
| Password | `pymc` |

### After Installation

```bash
# Enter the container
pct enter <CTID>

# View service logs
journalctl -u openhop-repeater -f

# Manage the repeater
cd /opt/openhop_repeater
bash manage.sh
```

Open the dashboard at:

```text
http://<container-ip>:8000
```

### CH341 GPIO Pin Mapping

The Proxmox installer pre-configures CH341 GPIO pins for an E22 module. These
are not Raspberry Pi BCM pin numbers:

| Function | CH341 GPIO | Pi BCM Default |
|----------|-----------:|---------------:|
| CS | 0 | 21 |
| RXEN | 1 | -1 |
| Reset | 2 | 18 |
| Busy | 4 | 20 |
| IRQ | 6 | 16 |

The installer also enables `use_dio3_tcxo` and `use_dio2_rf` for E22 modules.

### Troubleshooting

- **USB device not found**: confirm the CH341 is plugged into the Proxmox host
  and appears in `lsusb -d 1a86:5512`.
- **Permission denied on USB**: the installer creates
  `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-ch341.rules`. Run `udevadm trigger` on the host if
  needed.
- **Container cannot see USB**: verify USB passthrough lines exist in
  `/etc/pve/lxc/<CTID>.conf`:

  ```text
  lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 189:* rwm
  lxc.mount.entry: /dev/bus/usb dev/bus/usb none bind,optional,create=dir 0 0
  ```

- **NoBackendError for libusb**: the installer installs `libusb-1.0-0`
  automatically. If needed, run `apt-get install libusb-1.0-0` inside the
  container.

## Uninstallation

```bash
sudo bash ./manage.sh uninstall
```

The uninstaller will:

- Stop and disable the systemd service
- Remove the installation directory
- Optionally remove configuration, logs, and user data
- Optionally remove the service user account

The script prompts before each optional removal step.

## Docker Compose

You can run openHop Repeater in Docker using the published image.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` before starting:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `DIALOUT_GID`, `GPIO_GID`, and `SPI_GID` from `getent group dialout`,
`getent group gpio`, and `getent group spi` if your host values are different.

Default storage should use Docker named volumes. This avoids Portainer creating
root-owned `./config` and `./data` bind mount folders on first start. If you
want host bind mounts, use absolute host paths and pre-create/chown them to
`15888:15888`.

Do not mount `./config.yaml:/etc/openhop_repeater/config.yaml`; Docker can create
that source as a directory, which breaks startup.

### Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Review `.env` and update `OPENHOP_REPEATER_IMAGE`, `DIALOUT_GID`,
   `GPIO_GID`, or `SPI_GID` if needed.
3. Configure `docker-compose.yml` for your hardware and device paths.
4. Uncomment the USB device mapping only if your host has that device path.
5. Pull and start the container.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The Docker image bundles the optional PyMC Console frontend at
`/opt/pymc_console/web/html`. Local builds with `docker-compose.build.yml`
download the newest PyMC Console release by default. Set `PYMC_CONSOLE_VERSION`
in `.env` to pin a release tag such as `v0.9.329`.

After the container starts, open Web Settings and choose `PyMC Console` as the
web frontend if you want the repeater to serve that UI. The existing
`/api/check_pymc_console` endpoint should report that the Console path exists.

### Example `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
services:
  openhop-repeater:
    image: ${OPENHOP_REPEATER_IMAGE:-${PYMC_REPEATER_IMAGE:-openhop/openhop-repeater:main}}
    container_name: openhop-repeater
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8000:8000

    devices:
      # SPI devices. Your paths may differ. Remove if not using SPI hardware.
      - /dev/spidev0.0
      - /dev/gpiochip0

      # USB devices. Uncomment/change only if needed.
      # - /dev/bus/usb/002:/dev/bus/usb/002

    cap_add:
      - SYS_RAWIO

    group_add:
      - "${DIALOUT_GID:-20}"
      - "${GPIO_GID:-986}"
      - "${SPI_GID:-989}"
      - plugdev

    volumes:
      - ${OPENHOP_CONFIG_VOLUME:-${PYMC_CONFIG_VOLUME:-openhop-repeater-config}}:/etc/openhop_repeater
      - ${OPENHOP_DATA_VOLUME:-${PYMC_DATA_VOLUME:-openhop-repeater-data}}:/var/lib/openhop_repeater

volumes:
  openhop-repeater-config:
  openhop-repeater-data:
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Public map integration**: submit repeater location and details to a
  public map for discovery.
- [ ] **Remote administration over LoRa**: manage repeater configuration from
  the mesh.
- [ ] **Trace request handling**: respond to trace and diagnostic requests from
  the mesh network.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a feature branch from `dev`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name dev
   ```

3. Make your changes and test with real hardware when possible.
4. Commit with a clear message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: describe your change"
   ```

5. Push to your fork and open a pull request against `dev`.

Include a clear description, hardware tested, and any related issues.

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install in development mode with dev tools (ruff, pytest, mypy, etc)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Run checks manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Hardware support for LoRa radio drivers is included in the base installation
through `openhop_core[hardware]` on Linux. On other platforms (e.g. macOS),
`openhop_core` is installed without the hardware extra, since `spidev` and
similar packages only build against the Linux SPI kernel headers.

Pre-commit hooks will automatically:
- Lint and auto-fix Python issues with Ruff
- Validate formatting with Ruff formatter
- Fix trailing whitespace and other file issues
